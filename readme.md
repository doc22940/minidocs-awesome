# Minidocs Awesome

Automatically make a minidocs site from a awesome-repo. Pretty hacky and very WIP.

## Usage

Want to try it out? Sure why not. Find all occurrences of `clkao/awesome-dat` and replace it with the github awesome repo of your choice.

You'll have to replace it in:

* `package.json`, `update:list`
* `list.js`

Run it with: `npm run update && npm run build && npm start` and maybe it will work.
